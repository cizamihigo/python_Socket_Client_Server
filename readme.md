### About this project
we are just connecting one server to multiple users(clients)
    the purpose is to identify **one to many** connexion between the server and the clients
    The second goal was to  **broadcast** a message from one client passing through the server to 
    the other clients.
    the server is just a __pathway__ a gate to link both clients.
