### What is this Project :grinning:

###### this project is concerning python use of Sockets.
    >>> A network socket is an endpoint of an inter-process communication flow across a computer
    network. Sockets may communicate within a process, between processes on the same machine, or
    between processes on different continents 
    >>> Python provides two levels of access to network services. At a low level, you can access the basic
    socket support in the underlying operating system, which allows you to implement clients and
    servers for both connection-oriented and connectionless protocols. Python also has libraries that
    provide higher level access to specific application level network protocols, such as FTP, HTTP,
    SMTP, and so on. 
 Here the Level of accessing the network used is the low level in coming projects we will be accessing high level
 knowing that internet and network are the future. :mask:
